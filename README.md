# `Company Information`

Router Protocol is a solution introduced to address the issues hindering the usability of cross-chain liquidity migration in the DeFi ecosystem. It acts as a bridge connecting various layer 1 and layer 2 blockchains, allowing for the flow of contract-level data across them. The Router Protocol can either transfer tokens between chains or initiate operations on one chain and execute them on another.

Please check the [official documentation of Router Protocol](https://www.routerprotocol.com/)

# `Why participate in Router Student Expert Program`

We reward üèÖ badges to individuals who complete our Open Source assignments!

The journey is divided into multiple stages, each with its own set of points.

# Assignment

## Create browser extension that connects [api.opensauced.pizza](https://api.opensauced.pizza/) to a github.com profile.

### Task instructions

1. Create an OpenSauced account by connecting your GitHub to [opensauced.pizza](https://insights.opensauced.pizza)
1. Generate a [vite](https://vitejs.dev/) powered browser extension using the [CRXJS](https://crxjs.dev/vite-plugin/getting-started/vanilla-js/create-project) guide. Note there are two versions, vite@3 is in beta but both will work fine for this assignment. You can also leverage this [DEV post](https://dev.to/jacksteamdev/create-a-vite-react-chrome-extension-in-90-seconds-3df7) and the projects GitHub Discussion for additional help. This project is an open book assignment, so google as much as you'd like.
1. Connect your localhost power extension to your browser. You should not be deploying this to production or any browser store. 
1. Write a function that validates if an OpenSauced user account exists (using the OpenSauced API) for a GitHub user profile while viewing them on github.com. 

The final solution should only show a button if the GitHub user profile if the GitHub user is signed up for OpenSauced.

API example:

When viewing [bdougie](https://github.com/bdougie) you will check his handle using the users service in api.opensauced.pizza to confirm he is an OpenSauced user. When checking [defunkt](https://github.com/defunkt) you will confirm he is not an OpenSauced user.

```
https://api.opensauced.pizza/v1/users/bdougie // returns 200
https://api.opensauced.pizza/v1/users/defunkt // return 404
```

Things to consider:

1. You can leverage the extension's popup to test the API by replace the Vite boilerplate.
1. Limit this extension to only work on github.com profile pages. hint: the project will default to google.com, you will need to change that.
1. Adding a button can be done using React, Vue, HTMl, what you prefer. The button should actually link to the OpenSauced profile if it exists.
1. What else? How can you make this better? Auth to OpenSauced? Other Features?

### Task Expectations

Expectation is your extension only works when the user is on GitHub and can interact with the page. This interaction is to add a button that links to the users profile. 

- If there is missing documentation for OpenSauced, a contribution or open issue to the [docs](https://docs.opensauced.pizza/) repository is expected.
- If you are blocked longer than 2-3 hours, [ask in the Discussions](https://github.com/open-sauced-craftwork/browser-extension/discussions). Linking errors messages or StackOverflow questions is the preferred way to provide context when asking for help.
- To better understand the OpenSauced, join the [Discord Community](https://discord.gg/opensauced).

### Task submission

Students are expected to use the [GitHub Flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow) when working on their project. 

1. Creating a new branch
2. Making changes on the new branch to complete the task
4. Using GitHub Discussions to ask any relevant questions regarding the project
